Super communicative with booking and great hospitality. Blaine was knowledgeable and highly-skilled in the Asian style that I wanted. His experience shows and he created something that blended in well with the rest of my tattoos. Soft touch, even on my sunburnt skin. Will definitely be coming back for more the next time I vacation here.",
